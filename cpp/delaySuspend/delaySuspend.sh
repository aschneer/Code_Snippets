# This script will have the terminal wait a specified
# amount of time, and then put the computer into
# sleep mode.  I do this to watch a TV show while
# going to bed so that the computer will suspend
# after I fall asleep.  I don't want it to be on
# all night.

# Wait specified amount of time.
sleep 2h

# Execute suspend command.
sudo pm-suspend
